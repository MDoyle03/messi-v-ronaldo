<p>Messi and ronaldo have been at the top for the last decade. Both are considered to be the greatest of all time. Some say there is no right or wrong answer on who is better. I am here to prove why messi is the best by breaking down every statistic.Here on this page its clear to see Lionel messi is the better goal scorer and playmaker while being 2 years younger. Messi can run a game while Cristiano Ronaldo Waits for the right timing and places himself in position to be set up for a goal.</p>
